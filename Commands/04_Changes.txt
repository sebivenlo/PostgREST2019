#1 Try to do a curl command in git bash or cygwin to make changes

curl http://localhost:3000/timetable?period=eq.1 -X PATCH \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"room": "W 1.90"}'

create role teacher nologin;
grant teacher to authenticator;

grant usage on schema fontys to teacher;
grant all on fontys.timetable to teacher;

     -H "Authorization: Bearer <yourToken>" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
